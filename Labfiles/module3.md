## Task 1: Using Reusable Workflow

Rather than copying and pasting from one workflow to another, you can make workflows reusable. You and anyone with access to the reusable workflow can then call the reusable workflow from another workflow. Reusing workflows avoids duplication. This makes workflows easier to maintain and allows you to create new workflows more quickly by building on the work of others, just as you do with actions. Workflow reuse also promotes best practices by helping you use workflows that are well-designed, have already been tested, and have been proven to be effective. Your organization can build up a library of reusable workflows that can be centrally maintained. For more information, please go through the given link on [reusing workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows).

1. From the **gitHub-action** repository, navigate to the **.github/workflows** folder, click on **Add file** **(1)**, and select the **+ Create new file** **(2)** option.

    ![](../media/create-yml-file.png)

1. Copy the code given below, **paste (1)** it in the window name the file as **reusable-print-message.yml (2)** and click on **Commit changes (3)**.

   ```
   # This GitHub Actions workflow template is designed as a reusable component for printing a message.
   # It is triggered when called by another workflow using 'workflow_call', expecting a required input 'message' of type string.
   name: Reusable Print Message

   on:
     # Triggered when this workflow is called by another workflow
     workflow_call:
       inputs:
         # Defines a required input parameter 'message' of type string
         message:
           required: true
           type: string

   jobs:
     # Job named 'print-message' runs on an Ubuntu environment
     print-message:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         # Step to print the received message to the workflow log
         - name: Print message
           run: echo "Hi, this message is from primary workflow"
   ```

   ![](../media/reusable-print-message-create.png)

1. In the **Commit changes (1)** pop-up window, click on the **Commit changes (2)** option.

   ![](../media/reusable-print-message-commit.png)

   > **Note:** This GitHub Actions workflow template, named "Reusable Print Message," is designed to be a reusable component triggered by another workflow using **workflow_call**. It requires a string input parameter **message**. The workflow runs a job called **print-message** on an Ubuntu environment, which includes a step to print the received message to the workflow log.

1. Again, navigate to `.github/workflows`, Click on the **Add file (1)** dropdown and select **+ Create new file (2)**.

   ![](../media/create-yml-file.png)

1. Copy the code given below, paste it into the window, and name the file **caller-workflows.yml** and click on **Commit changes**.

   ```
   name: Caller Workflow

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main
       paths:
         - '.github/workflows/caller-workflows.yml'
     workflow_dispatch:

   jobs:
     # Job to call the reusable workflow
     call-reusable-workflow:
       # Specifies the path to the reusable workflow
       uses: ./.github/workflows/reusable-print-message.yml
       with:
         # Passes the message to the reusable workflow
         message: "Hello from the caller workflow!"
    ```

   ![](../media/caller-workflows-create.png)   

1. On the **Commit changes (1)** pop-up window, click on the **Commit changes (2)** option.

   ![](../media/caller-workflows-commit.png)

1. Now, navigate to the **Actions (1)** tab and select **Create caller-workflow.yml (2)**. 

   ![](../media/caller-workflows-final.png)

1. Select the **print-message (1)** option from the side-blade and **expand (2)** the same in the output window. You'll see that the message from `reusable-print-message.yml` is fetched by the caller workflow. This is how the concept of reusable workflows in GitHub Actions works.

   ![](../media/caller-workflows-output.png)

   > **Note:** This GitHub Actions workflow named "Caller Workflow" triggers on pushes to the main branch and manual dispatch for changes to the **.github/workflows/caller-workflows.yml** file. It calls a reusable workflow defined in **reusable-print-message.yml**, passing the message "Hello from the caller workflow!".

### Task 2: Explanation and Usage of Matrix Builds

Matrix builds and parallelism are advanced features in GitHub Actions that allow you to run multiple jobs concurrently.

Matrix builds let you test your code across multiple environments by creating a job matrix. This is a set of keys and values that create a combination of conditions and run a job for each one.

Parallelism allows you to run jobs or steps concurrently, reducing the total execution time.

In this task, you'll fork a public repository and create a GitHub action using Matrix build.

1. Navigate to the [sample-node-project](https://github.com/acemilyalcin/sample-node-project) repo and click on **Fork**.

    ![](../media/sample-node-project-fork.png)

    > **Note**: If a fork already exists, follow the below steps to delete the repository.
    
    - In the upper-right corner, navigate to the user menu and select **Your repositories** **(1)**.
       
      ![The `New Repository` creation form in GitHub.](../media/my_repos.png "New Repository Creation Form")

### Task 3: Matrix Builds for Testing Across Multiple Environments

A matrix build is a CI/CD pipeline strategy that allows you to run tests across a variety of environments simultaneously. Each environment can vary by operating system, programming language version, dependency versions, and other factors. The matrix build configuration defines combinations of these variables, creating a grid (or matrix) of different test scenarios.

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensures that your software works under different configurations, reducing the risk of environment-specific bugs.

- **Parallel Execution**: Tests can run in parallel, speeding up the testing process and providing faster feedback.

- **Consistency**: It helps maintain consistent behavior across different environments, which is crucial for cross-platform applications.

In this task, you'll set up a GitHub action using the Matrix strategy to run the build across multiple OS simultaneously.

### Task 4: Using Artifacts and Dependencies in Workflows

Optimizing workflow performance by caching dependencies can significantly improve the execution time of your workflows. By caching dependencies, you can avoid unnecessary downloads and installations, resulting in faster and more efficient workflows.

- **Identify Dependencies**: Determine which dependencies in your project take a long time to install.
- **Add Cache Step**: In your GitHub Actions workflow file, add a step that uses the `actions/cache@v4` action.
- **Configure Cache Key**: Set the `key` to an expression that uniquely identifies each set of dependencies. This typically includes the package manager's lock file.
- **Specify Path**: Set the `path` to the directory where dependencies are installed.
- **Restore Cache**: If a cache hit occurs, the action restores the cached dependencies.
